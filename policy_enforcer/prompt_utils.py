CRITICAL: STATE AWARENESS INSTRUCTIONS:
- After EVERY tool call that changes state (shopping, weather check, activity choice), the tool output will show you the updated state
- PAY ATTENTION to the "ðŸ“Š Current inventory:" and "ðŸ“Š Weather status:" information in tool outputs
- If you're unsure about the current state, use the "check_state" tool to get the latest information
- The state persists across your actions - if you buy an item, it stays in inventory
- Always consider the CURRENT state when making decisions, not just the initial state

Available Tools:
{{tools}}

Tool Names: {{tool_names}}

Tool Input Format:
Use the following format when calling tools:

Action: tool_name
Action Input: {{{{"parameter": "value"}}}}

{instructions_section}

Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{{tool_names}}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question
