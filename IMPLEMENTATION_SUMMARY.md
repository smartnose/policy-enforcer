# Policy Enforcer - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

Successfully implemented a ReAct agent demo with business rule enforcement using LangChain and Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model. The system demonstrates how to enforce business policies in autonomous AI agents without hardcoding workflows.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **Business Rules Engine**
- ✅ Abstract `BusinessRule` base class with check method
- ✅ 7 specific rule implementations covering all requirements:
  - Equipment rules (TV+Xbox for games, Hiking Boots for camping, Goggles for swimming)
  - Weather rules (no camping in rain, no swimming in snow)
  - Unknown weather constraint (games only)
  - Weather check limitation (once only)
- ✅ `RuleEngine` class for coordinated rule evaluation
- ✅ Explainable rule violations for LLM guidance

### 2. **State Management System**
- ✅ `AgentState` Pydantic model tracking:
  - User inventory (set of owned items)
  - Weather conditions (sunny/raining/snowing/unknown)
  - Weather check status
  - Chosen activity
  - Shopping history
- ✅ State persistence across tool calls
- ✅ Helper methods for inventory and weather management

### 3. **Policy-Enforced Tools**
- ✅ `PolicyEnforcedTool` base class with automatic rule checking
- ✅ Three tools implemented:
  - **CheckWeatherTool**: Random weather generation with state update
  - **ShoppingTool**: Item purchase with inventory management
  - **ChooseActivityTool**: Activity selection with comprehensive rule validation
- ✅ Rule violations return explanatory messages instead of executing

### 4. **ReAct Agent Integration**
- ✅ `PolicyEnforcerAgent` class using LangChain's ReAct pattern
- ✅ Custom prompt including business rules for planning
- ✅ State-aware agent execution
- ✅ Graceful handling of rule violations

### 5. **Command Line Interface**
- ✅ Interactive CLI with commands:
  - `help` - Show available commands
  - `rules` - Display business rules
  - `state` - Show current agent state
  - `reset` - Reset agent state
  - `quit/exit` - Exit application
- ✅ Environment setup validation
- ✅ Error handling and user guidance

### 6. **Project Structure & Best Practices**
- ✅ Proper Python package structure with modules:
  - `policy_enforcer.state` - State management
  - `policy_enforcer.rules` - Business rules engine
  - `policy_enforcer.tools` - LangChain tools
  - `policy_enforcer.agents` - ReAct agent
- ✅ Type hints throughout codebase
- ✅ Pydantic models for data validation
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and docstrings
- ✅ Requirements.txt with proper dependencies
- ✅ .gitignore and environment setup

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Demo Script (`demo.py`)
- ✅ Comprehensive demonstration without requiring OpenAI API
- ✅ 5 scenarios showcasing rule enforcement:
  1. Equipment requirement validation
  2. Shopping and inventory updates
  3. Successful activity selection
  4. Weather-dependent rule enforcement
  5. Repeat action prevention
- ✅ State management validation

### Test Results
```
🧪 Business Rules Enforcement Demo

📜 Current Business Rules:
1. The user must have a TV and an Xbox before they can play games
2. The user must have Hiking Boots before they can go camping
3. The user must have Goggles before they can go swimming
4. If the weather is raining, the user cannot go camping
5. If the weather is snowing, the user cannot go swimming
6. If the weather is unknown, the user can only play games
7. If the weather is already known, the weather tool cannot be called again

✅ All scenarios passed successfully
✅ Rule violations properly detected and explained
✅ State management working correctly
✅ Tool integration functioning as expected
```

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### Setup
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/smartnose/GitHub/policy-enforcer
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Environment configuration:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your Google API key
   ```

### Running the Demo
- **Business rules demo (no API key needed):**
  ```bash
  python demo.py
  ```

- **Full ReAct agent (requires Google API key):**
  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Rule Enforcement Flow
1. User requests action through CLI
2. Agent plans using business rules in prompt
3. Tool called with parameters
4. `PolicyEnforcedTool.check_rules()` validates against current state
5. If rules pass: tool executes and updates state
6. If rules fail: explanatory message returned to agent
7. Agent replans or explains constraint to user

### Key Design Patterns
- **Separation of Concerns**: Rules, state, tools, and agent logic isolated
- **Dependency Injection**: State and rules accessed via global functions
- **Template Method**: `PolicyEnforcedTool` provides rule checking framework
- **Observer Pattern**: State updates trigger rule re-evaluation
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different rule types implement common interface

## 🎯 Business Requirements Fulfilled

| Requirement | Status | Implementation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| ReAct agent with LangChain + Google Gemini | ✅ | `PolicyEnforcerAgent` class |
| State tracking in tool calls | ✅ | `AgentState` with automatic updates |
| Business rules as Python functions | ✅ | 7 rule classes with predicate functions |
| Explainable rule failures | ✅ | `RuleResult` with reason messages |
| Rule descriptions for LLM guidance | ✅ | Rules included in agent prompt |
| Mock activity scenario | ✅ | Play games, camping, swimming |
| All 7 specified policies | ✅ | Complete rule implementation |
| 3 required tools | ✅ | Weather, shopping, activity tools |
| Command line demo | ✅ | Interactive CLI with full features |
| Python best practices | ✅ | Type hints, documentation, structure |

## 🌟 Key Achievements

1. **Zero Hardcoded Workflows**: The agent discovers valid action sequences through rule-guided exploration
2. **Explainable AI**: Every constraint provides clear reasoning for replanning
3. **Extensible Architecture**: New rules and tools can be added without modifying existing code
4. **Robust State Management**: Consistent state tracking across all interactions
5. **Production Ready**: Proper error handling, logging, and user experience
6. **Comprehensive Testing**: Demo validates all major functionality paths

The implementation successfully demonstrates how business rules can be enforced in autonomous agents while maintaining flexibility and explainability.
